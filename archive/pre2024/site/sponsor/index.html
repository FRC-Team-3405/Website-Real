                    <h3>Why Sponsor Team 3405?</h3>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            Team 3405 was started at Maple Mountain High School in 2010. That year, they went on to win
                            the Utah Regional Championship. Since then, Team 3405 has been a finalist in the regional
                            competition 3 times, moved over to Nebo's Advanced Learning Center and become the
                            district-wide robotics team. Team 3405 is filled with the best and the brightest STEM
                            students that Nebo School District has to offer. Unfortunately, in past years, our numbers
                            have been few, and we haven't had much support from the community. You can help change that!
                            This year we're focusing on creating a program that lasts. On Team 3405 students will learn
                            important industry skills, giving them an education that lasts for life. Teamwork is as
                            important a skill in the FIRST Robotics Competition as it is in the "real world". Students
                            will learn to deal with stressful situations, meet a deadline, and prototype, build, and
                            program a full-size robot from the ground up.
                        </p>

                            Unfortunately, to provide such a fantastic opportunity for our students is quite expensive,
                            but with <strong>your</strong> help we can grant this future generation of scientists,
                            engineers, programmers, and mathematicians a fantastic opportunity for intellectual and
                            social growth.
