        Team 3405, the ALChemists (previously the Golden Eagle Bots) started competing in the FIRST Robotics
        Competition in 2010, and won the regional championship in their rookie year. They have since been Regional
        finalists in the 2011, 2014, and 2015 seasons.

                    <h3>Kickoff Recap</h3>
                    <div class="content">
                        Kickoff was today! Thanks to everyone who came and ate our waffles! If you missed it, sorry, no
                        waffles for you. However, if you missed kickoff, there are a couple things you'll need to know:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                The game was released! This year's game has some very unique challenges. Watch the
                                game animation below for the specifics.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Next week, we are meeting after school on Tuesday and Thursday, as well as all morning
                                on Friday (no school!) and Saturday. By the end of the week we are going to have a
                                prototype of our robot completely built and driving around.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Everybody that is interested in coming to the competition needs to read the game manual!
                                You can find it
                                <a href="https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2019/Manual/2019FRCGameSeasonManual.pdf">here</a>
                                (The password is <b>$Robots&in#SPACE!!</b>). The manual is long (129 pages), but it's
                                definitely worth your time to understand the rules of the game you're playing.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                We are considering booking hotel rooms in Salt Lake City for the duration of the
                                competition. This will help reduce stress overall and give us some more time to sleep,
                                which is always nice! Unfortunately, this will mean the trip will cost more for all
                                students. This also means we will need to have another parent meeting to approve the
                                trip. If this cost would be a burden to you or your family, come talk to Mr. Eastmond,
                                Jerica, or Matthew and we can discuss some further options. More details will be
                                forthcoming as we get the trip approved by the district.

                                Bring sketches of some T-shirt design ideas next week if you'd like to help design the
                                T-shirt.

                        In addition to watching the game animation, we discussed a couple ideas for the robot. Nothing
                        is set in stone now, so we'll continue discussing design ideas next week.
