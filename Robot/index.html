          GLaDOS
        </h1>
        <p>
            GLaDOS is a small, Light weight robot, built for the 2024 First Robotics Competition season "Crescendo ''. 
            The drive base is a swerve drive, mk4i from SDS, with 8 falcon 500 motors. Built with a small frame perimeter,
            22 inches, and lightweight parts. Our bot was the lightest at the Utah Regional competition, weighing only 70 pounds!
            Our robot features a over the bumper intake system with rollers powered by 5:1 775 pro motors, and actuation achieved
            by a 125:1 NEO motor. The intake folds out to the ground to pick up the notes, and features a limit switch to detect
            when a note has been picked up allowing it to automatically retract. The intake feeds directly into our launcher,
            featuring 2 sets of stealth wheels powered by 3:1 NEO motors. Our robot includes 2 cameras, a back facing standard
            camera for note pickup. and a front facing Limelight camera for april tag detection and automatic alignment.
            Programmed in Java, we use  2 controllers, a main movement controller done with a flightstick with wrist rotation,
            and a secondary subsystems controller to enable our intake and launcher systems. For autonomous we use PathPlanner
            to allow us to customize our autonomous routines as our teammates need. We have been able to refine our main route
            and can constantly get 2-3 notes, and have a star autonomous with 4 note capability. </p>
