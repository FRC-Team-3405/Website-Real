  <!-- The header is used to showcase some of the many qualities FIRST students
  discover, develop, or gain as they progress in the STEM fields. In these qualities,
  we must always include the aims, vision, and mission of the ALC, Nebo School District, 
  and FIRST. The ALC's montra of "Explore. Discover. Create." is easily seen as part of
  this list. "Inspire", "Excel", "Lead", and "Innovate" have been taken from or 
  inspired by the vision and mission of FIRST. Nebo's mission is to "Engage, Empower, 
  Collaborate, and Prepare". The power of collaboration and engagement is showcased
  firsthand in all the aspects and values of FIRST. -->
